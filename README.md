# Sora Programming Language VS Code Extension 

Sora is a human-centric, natural-language-inspired programming language designed to make coding as intuitive and readable as conversation. It aims to bridge the gap between human thought and machine logic by allowing developers — beginners and professionals alike — to express computation in grammatical, structured English.

The architecture of Sora is not just syntactic; it's cognitive. Sora assumes that code should mirror how people think, speak, and reason, reducing the intimidation often felt by newcomers while enhancing clarity for experienced developers.
