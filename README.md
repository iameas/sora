# Sora Porgramming Language

Sora is a simple, human-readable programming language designed for both developers and non-developers. It is built to:
- Describe logic as readable sentences
- Create user interfaces without tage or curly braces
- Use natural expressions like `let`, `be`, `show`, `make`, `and`, `is`
- Bridge the gap between no-code, pseudo-code, and real-code
